A mod that will add The Escort and (eventually) their very special slugpup.
[i]Thank you Walkfu for the placeholder headshot art (the design is not yet finalized)[/i]

Currently implements The Escort and some of their abilities and movement tech. 
[i]Should[/i] be fully compatible for playing in other campaigns or arena.

[b]Feedback of any sort is HIGHLY appreciated![/b]

[hr][/hr][h2]<~DISCLAIMER~>[/h2]
Escort's campaign doesn't exist, there's no custom assets, and this may or may not alter the behaviour of other slugcats by pure accident (it's unlikely for this to happen)...

[*] grab thrown objects midair and hurl it back
[*] prioritize spears when picking up while doing Stun Slide or Drop Kick
