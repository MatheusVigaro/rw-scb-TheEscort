A mod that will add The Escort and their very special slugpup.
[i]Thank you Walkfu for the placeholder headshot art (the design is not yet finalized)[/i]

Currently implements The Escort and some of their abilities and movement tech. 
[i]Should[/i] be fully compatible for playing in other campaigns or arena.

[b]Feedback of any sort is HIGHLY appreciated![/b]

Escort's campaign doesn't exist, there's no custom assets, and this may or may not alter the behaviour of other slugcats by pure accident (it's unlikely for this to happen)...
[hr][/hr][h2]<~CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED~>[/h2]
[list]
[*] Slide Stun (sliding into creature)
[*] Drop Kick (roll/slide pouncing into creature)
[*] Flip Pounce (charge pounce)
[*] Infinite roll
[*] half-implemented Parry Slide (slide into bites or stabby creatures and get away most of the time (bite lethality will still kill you)... but not spears, not yet)
[/list]
[hr][/hr][h2]<~TO BE IMPLEMENTED (in the near future)~>[/h2]
[list]
[*] Some creatures hate Escort's guts (and some will actively search for them)
[*] Parry Slide parrying spears
[*] grab thrown objects midair and hurl it back
[*] prioritize spears when picking up while doing Stun Slide or Drop Kick
[*] Remix menu to adjust multiple settings
[*] Code organization and comments for future me and y'all who want to use this code when I make the repository public...
[/list]
