A mod that will add The Escort and (eventually) their very special slugpup.
[i]Thank you Walkfu for the placeholder headshot art (the design is not yet finalized)[/i]

Currently implements The Escort and some of their abilities and movement tech. 
[i]Should[/i] be fully compatible for playing in other campaigns or arena.

[b]Feedback of any sort is HIGHLY appreciated![/b]

[hr][/hr][h2]<~DISCLAIMER~>[/h2]
Escort's campaign doesn't exist, there's no custom assets, and this may or may not alter the behaviour of other slugcats by pure accident (it's unlikely for this to happen)...

These mods may or may not cause issues with the Escort mod.
