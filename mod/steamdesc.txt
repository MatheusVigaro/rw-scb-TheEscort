A mod that will add The Escort and (eventually) their very special slugpup.
[i]Thank you Walkfu for the placeholder headshot art (the design is not yet finalized)[/i]

Currently implements The Escort and some of their abilities and movement tech. 
[i]Should[/i] be fully compatible for playing in other campaigns or arena.

[b]Feedback of any sort is HIGHLY appreciated![/b]

[hr][/hr][h2]<~DISCLAIMER~>[/h2]
Escort's campaign doesn't exist, there's no custom assets, and this may or may not alter the behaviour of other slugcats by pure accident (it's unlikely for this to happen)...
[hr][/hr][h2]<~CONFLICTING MODS/KNOWN ISSUES~>[/h2]
These mods may or may not cause issues with the Escort mod, or these are issues that have been found and will be fixed eventually
[list]
[*] Gutter water is still super buoyant... but I won't be messing around with gutter water no more.
[*] Garbage Waste doesn't work properly
[*] When playing COOP in Escort's Campaign, the food intake doesn't work properly (gives you too much food actually)
[*] Escort starts in water... that'll be fixed once I make a custom room.
[*] Spearthrowing mechanics are still a wee bit janky and needs cleanup.
[*] And probably more, there are way too many mods to test this character with...

[hr][/hr][h2]<~PATCHED MODS~>[/h2]
This mod will apply a patch to work better with the following mods. How they change the behaviour of the Escort mod is as detailed (Any mods not listed in either conflicts or patched may be assumed to be working):

[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2950327774]Revivify[/url]: [b]Working on a patch for 1.2.0[/b] Grabbing dead slugpups/players will default to base game behaviour (overrides tweaks done in this mod)

[hr][/hr][h2]<~CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED~>[/h2]
[list]
[*] REMIX MENU to tweak some features and enable optional gimmicks
[*] Slide Stun (sliding into creature)
[*] Drop Kick (roll/slide pouncing into creature)
[*] Flip Pounce (charge pounce)
[*] Flip wall jump (holding down and direction (towards the wall) while on the wall, then pressing jump)
[*] Infinite roll
[*] Dual wield spears (and dead lizards)
[*] Half-implemented Parry Slide (slide into bites or stabby creatures and get away most of the time (bite lethality will still kill you)... but not spears, not yet)
[*] Battle-Hyped: Keep your tired meter above a threshhold by engaging in combat to become stronger and faster. Let that adrenaline PUMP!
[*] Arc'd Spear (Monk throwing trajectory, Survivor damage (and way more when hyped!), (lesser) Gourmand forward thrust)
[*] Custom SFX!
[/list]
[hr][/hr][h2]<~TO BE IMPLEMENTED (when i feel liek it)~>[/h2]
[list]
[*] Sliding while hyped will be more lenient (slide success occurs in fewer frames alike how rivulet works)
[*] Escort Headbutt (when you speed out of a pipe)
[*] Escort shooting out of pipes
[*] Pull out of centipede grasps with STRENGTH (don't worry it'll have a cooldown)
[*] Some creatures hate Escort's guts (and some will actively search for them)
[*] grab thrown objects midair and hurl it back
[*] prioritize spears when picking up while doing Stun Slide or Drop Kick
[*] Code organization and comments for future me and y'all who want to use this code when I make the repository public...
[/list]
[hr][/hr][h2]<~GOALS~>[/h2]
[list]
[*] Complete Escort's moveset
[*] Add some fun gimmicks for Escort (All hostile creatures know what room you're in, harvest armor from centipedes, etc.)
[*] Add the special slugpup and their set AI
[*] Complete the campaign
