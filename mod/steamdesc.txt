A mod that will add The Escort and (eventually) their very special slugpup.
[i]Thank you Walkfu for the placeholder headshot art (the design is not yet finalized)[/i]

Currently implements The Escort and some of their abilities and movement tech. 
[i]Should[/i] be fully compatible for playing in other campaigns or arena.

[b]Feedback of any sort is HIGHLY appreciated![/b]

[hr][/hr][h2]<~DISCLAIMER~>[/h2]
Escort's campaign doesn't exist, there's no custom assets, and this may or may not alter the behaviour of other slugcats by pure accident (it's unlikely for this to happen)...
[hr][/hr][h2]<~CONFLICTING MODS/KNOWN ISSUES~>[/h2]
These mods may or may not cause issues with the Escort mod, or these are issues that have been found and will be fixed eventually
[list]
[*] Gutter water is still super buoyant... but I won't be messing around with gutter water no more.
[*] Garbage Waste doesn't work properly
[*] When playing COOP in Escort's Campaign, the food intake doesn't work properly (gives you too much food actually)
[*] Escort starts in water... that'll be fixed once I make a custom room.
[*] Spearthrowing mechanics are still a wee bit janky and needs cleanup.
[*] And probably more, there are way too many mods to test this character with...

These mods have been tested in isolation, so there's a chance having multiple may still result in a bug/crash. If so, please report it in the discussions!
