# About
Here's where I detail why each decision was made and justify how Escort got these abilities or world events.

## Lore reasons for Escort
Unencumbered swimming in Gutter Water: They grew up finding food in the thick water and learned to swim in it

Constant Speed: They didn't skip leg or arm day and can pace themselves while going fast enough to dodge danger

Parry Slide/Stun Slide: Due to constant lizards trying to hunt them down in tight corridors, they discovered a good way to get past them... by sliding right into danger.

Drop Kick: Though spears are abundant in the Gutter, Escort can only carry one at a time, meaning they had to find a way to deal with the lizards if they flanked them in a room with little to no spears... thus, with a lot of practice, they developed the drop kick.

Massive Stamina: Every day they deal with angry lizards constantly attacking, thus their stamina increased little by little.

Battle-Hyped: Though they do get tired, the adrenaline pumping through their system causes them to go faster and attack stronger!...
There may be something other than adrenaline pulsing inside them (perhaps diet void fluid?)

Design: Speaking of Void Fluid, when Battle-Hyped, Escort will have gold markings glow...


## Lore reasons for Escort's Slugpup (Still unnamed)
Found by Escort: They were a messenger sent to deliver a message... however, at some point they were captured by a lizard and was carried all the way to Moon and Pebble's. It will remain unknown whether the slugpup delievered the message or not, but regardless they will have the mark of communication and will talk to the iterators that way.

Escort can get the mark of commmunication only if they don't have their slugpup with them when meeting Moon.
