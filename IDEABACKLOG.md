* *(0.2.X)* Idea backlog...
    * Changed how settings are applied in game (you shouldn't notice any changes)
    * Escort can throw better in water.
    * Swim speed is properly affected by their movement speed.  Dropkick is now affected by player weight (Hey rotund world!)
    * Brawler can no longer dualwield any weapon.
    * Escapist can no longer throw spears? But unique backspear.
    * Double flashbang causes shockwave on impact, double rock knocks back harder, double firecracker throws hard and activates instantly. Lizards grabbing player will no longer cause flight (player lets go of lizard when grabbed by that lizard). Brawler also no longer stuns creatures when grabbing onto them.
    * Railgunner gets double the amount of slowstun
    * Kickflips are done with slide pounces but not on roll pounces
    * VFX for punches are different from shanks
    * Fix midair spear grab
    * Escapist only tosses spears now, but much longer leniency on escaping
    * Socks grapple gives a bit more air time when not attached to anything
    * Socks grapple works in ZeroG properly
    * Socks can have different grapples for different effects (tonguing a shocky thing gives it electric tongue)
    * Make Socks grapple have less... elasticness and not be grabbable by wormgrass
    * Socks has reduced movement bonuses when tired
    * Give Deflector throwskill of 1 to make ricochets possible... and also let the roll throws travel
    * Give speedster more VFX for how charged they are, and fix the VFX for getting the charge when going up or down (to make it look less awkward)
    * Properly implement Grapple Backpack template
    * Parry Upgrade update
    * Fix Escapist wall spears
    * Remove reverb from shank noise
    * Might remove Brawler shank for zeroG
    * Change how sprites are loaded (have only one spritesheet), create a template, and create multiple versions just to get started. (And also make the head sprite resize dynamically such as shrinking and moving when going left vs right vs standing etc.)
    * Each escort build changes color if custom colors are off, or default jolly colors are on.
    * Normal Escort cutscene: Swims up from the water, grabs two spears, and spears one in the weird jump.
    * Brawler starts at Outskirts [SU-A02], cutscene: Shanks a freaking pink
    * Deflector starts at Sky Islands [SI-C03], cutscene: Deflects king tusk harpoons, then upspears it
    * Escapist starts at Exterior (Moon) [DM-LEG02], cutscene: Spider grabby and carry
    * Railgunner starts at Garbage Wastes [GW-C02_PAST], cutscene: Waits, aims and shoots a lizard
    * Speedster starts at Farms Array [LF-E03], cutscene: Running from lizor, boosts, but slams into a scav at the toll, and now scavs angy
    * Gilded starts at Rubicon and ends at Rubicon there is no escape teehee
    * Add/remove sound effect to tell if Escort is dropkicking a live creature or a dead one
    * Add Railgunner knockback for other double-ups (maybe by having the knockback get introduced in frame 2 or 3)
    * Reduce stunslide uncontrollability by changeing it to a roll and balance it. Also have a new way to trigger the combo
    * Deflector's damage increases by 0.001f for every kill in the whole campaign.
    * Wallpounces don't work with dk animation
    * Add spiking
    * (Brawler throws spears and rocks when sliding forward)
    * (Escort vertical pole climb)

* *(0.2.13)* Redo Escapist (so it ain't for some "Tories" (what does this even mean, Balagaga?!))

* *(0.2.12)* Ability update!
    * Regular Escort can Suplex
    * Bombs do explosive punches (Brawler)
    * Deflects weapons properly (sends them back to the sender) (Deflector)
    * NONE-REWORK SOON(Escapist)
    * Two rocks + one food pip = bomb, two spears + one food pip = fire spear (Railgunner)
    * While in speeding state, sliding under enemy causes them to launch upwards (Speedster)
    * NONE-TOO RECENT(Gilded)

* *(0.2.11)* Fleshed Out Story (Part 2) Update

* *(0.2.10)* Gilded. (another idea: Blast away the creatures for safety)

* *(0.2.8.13)* Added option to revert to previous behaviour for those who prefer the old ways
