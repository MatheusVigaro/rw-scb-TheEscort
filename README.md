# About
**The Escort.**
Y'all are free to adapt the code for your own usage as long as the original authors (who developed the Slugbase and Rain World and the DLC) are fine with it.

# Version History (Newest to Oldest):
## Version 0: Escort's Beginning
        Development starts here. Goal? To have a complete enough slugcat that can be used in Arena and other campaigns.
### 0.0 - Pre-release
**(0.0.13)** Gave Escort faster movement on pole walking or hanging, added a stop condition for the infiniroll (so it behaves more like how regular rolls work, as long as you're holding the right buttons it keeps rollin'), and attempted to patch out Escort's Elevator

**(0.0.12.3)** Changed parry sound so it actually gives feedback properly

**(0.0.12.2)** Fixed friendly fire shenanigans, nerfed stun and damage of Stun Slide, buffed damage of drop kick, and acknowledge Escort's Elevator (ramping off of creature may cause the Escort to launch upwards)

**(0.0.12.1)** Changed the translation to a flip since a rocket jump from a charge pounce is a bit too overpowered

**(0.0.12)** Translated charge pounce to rocket jump

**(0.0.11.3)** Added some kind of roadmap (it's not much)

**(0.0.11.2)** Added text to README and finally updated the github repository

**(0.0.11.1)** Fixed Parry Slide to a certain degree. It will sometimes parry lizard bites, untested for noodlefly mother spearing, and does not work against thrown spears.

**(0.0.11)** Implemented Parry Slide... which also doesn't work

**(0.0.10.1)** Added the spear grab effect to Stun Slide

**(0.0.10)** Added Better Slide... which is meant to make slide pounces easier, however it does not work...

**(0.0.9.4)** Removed the animations to reduce the chance of triggering Drop Kick from a Stun Slide or repeating Drop Kick infinitely

**(0.0.9.3)** Removed the static bounceback after finding a more reliable trajectory setting

**(0.0.9.2)** Changed the animation that plays at the end of Stun Slide and Drop Kick

**(0.0.9.1)** Added static bounceback since the original solution's trajectory was inconsistent

**(0.0.9)** Adjusted trajectory of Drop Kick to make it more consistent

**(0.0.8)** Attempted to implement exhausion such that Escort doesn't get tired as fast... not working as of now

**(0.0.7)** Implemented Infiniroll

**(0.0.6.1)** Converted Super Stun Pounce to Drop Kick (and removed knockback on Stun Slide)

**(0.0.6)** Converted Slam Slide to Stun Slide by giving it stun, and reduced stun on Super Stun Pounce and gave it a lot more knockback

**(0.0.5)** Implemented CarryHeavy, allowing Escort to lug around things that are heavier than them

**(0.0.4.2)** Added spear grab to Super Stun Pounce (alike the behaviour of whiplash)

**(0.0.4.1)** Adjusted Slam Slide to launch Escort forward instead of bouncing back, giving them a unique movement tech that allows them to cover more horizontal distance

**(0.0.4)** Implemented BodySlam (Slam Slide and Super Stun Pounce), allowing Escort to slide into creatures to cause knockback. 

**(0.0.3)** Implemented BetterCrawl, allowing Escort to crawl at different speeds.

**(0.0.2.2)** Set the default color of Escort to royal blue

**(0.0.2.1)** Adjusted the slug stats some more

**(0.0.2)** Made the mod work and linked the project so I can stop copy and pasting everything

**(0.0.1)** Imported the template, disabled some template features, and adjusted the slug stats

**(0.0.0)** Cloned template.
